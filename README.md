# Network Filtering Script

## Overview
This repository contains a **bash script** to filter a gene co-expression network into sub-networks based on gene types (Plant, Pathogen, Hyperparasite) and summarize the number of nodes and edges. The script is designed for networks in CSV format.

The original network file should have the following columns:

Gene1,Gene2,Correlation,Sign,n_overlap


Gene IDs should follow the patterns:

- **Plant genes:** `Eucgr.*`  
- **Pathogen genes:** `APSI_.*`  
- **Hyperparasite genes:** `DN*`

---

## Files

- `filter_networks.sh` — Main script to filter the network and summarize edges/nodes.  
- `filtered_edges.csv` — Example input network file (must be provided by the user).  
- Output files (generated by the script):  
  - `pathogen_hyper_only_edges.csv`  
  - `plant_hyper_only_edges.csv`  
  - `plant_pathogen_only_edges.csv`  

---

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x filter_networks.sh


Place your filtered_edges.csv file in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:

./filter_networks.sh


The script will generate the filtered sub-networks and print a summary of:

Total edges

Positive edges

Negative edges

Number of nodes

Filtering Logic

Pathogen ↔ Hyperparasite: Removes plant genes.

Plant ↔ Hyperparasite: Includes edges between plant and hyperparasite genes only.

Plant ↔ Pathogen: Includes edges between plant and pathogen genes only.

Requirements

Linux or macOS environment

awk, sort, uniq, wc available (standard Unix tools)

Example Output
Pathogen-Hyperparasite network summary:
  Total edges: 120,356
  Positive edges: 62,000
  Negative edges: 58,356
  Nodes: 15,483
